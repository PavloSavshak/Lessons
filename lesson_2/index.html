				<a href="https://www.loudersound.com/tag/slipknot">Slipknot</a> have come a long
				way. From the basements of Des Moines, Iowa, to the main stage at <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/download-festival-tickets-lineup-rumours-announcements-and-more">Download
					festival</a>, Slipknot's journey is one of inspiration. One of the most successful metal band's of
				the century, and one of the few to emerge from the nu metal boom of the early noughties with their
				integrity in tact, the nine-man killing machine have released five albums and played to millions of fans
				(also known as maggots) throughout the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				But it hasn't been easy. Iowa remains one of the darkest records of all time, owing much to the psyche
				and headspace the band were occupying at the time, and the band's <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/slipknot-s-paul-gray-remembered">founding member Paul
					Gray died in 2010.</a>

				If you're new to the world of Slipknot then welcome, but tread carefully, because here be monsters.
				Below, we'll answer any question you may have. Who are Slipknot? What's up with that nine-pointed star?
				What are their biggest songs? What is Knotfest? Let's see...

			<h2 id="p-2">Who are the members of Slipknot?</h2>
			<p>
				There are nine members of Slipknot, although the line-up has changed numerous
				times since their formation in 1995. The current line-up of Slipknot is <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/corey-taylor-the-10-records-that-changed-my-life">Corey
					Taylor</a> on vocals, <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/shawn-crahan-10-facts-about-slipknot-s-clown">Shawn
					‘Clown’ Crahan</a> and <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/why-i-love-venom-by-chris-fehn-slipknot">Chris Fehn</a>
				on percussion, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/discs-of-doom-mick-thomson-slipknot">Mick
					Thomson</a> and Jim Root on guitar, Alessandro ‘V Man’ Venturella on bass, Jay Weinberg on drums,
				Sid Wilson on turntables and Craig ‘133’ Jones on samples and keyboards.
			</p>
			<p>
				The classic Slipknot line-up (from 1999-2010) featured <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-a-z-guide-joey-jordison-slipknot-vimic-sinsaenum-murderdolls-scar-the-martyr">Joey
					Jordison</a> on drums and Paul Gray on bass. Paul Gray was replaced by V Man in 2014 following
				Paul’s death in 2010, and Jay Weinberg replaced Joey Jordison following his departure from Slipknot
				in2013 following a battle with his health.

			<h2 id="p-3">Who were the original members of Slipknot?</h2>
			<p>
				The majority of the current Slipknot line-up were not original members – in fact, only Shawn
				Crahan remains from the early days. Formed in Iowa in 1995, Slipknot featured Anders Colsefni on vocals,
				Donnie Steel and Josh Brainard on guitar, Joey Jordison on drums, Clown on percussion and Paul Gray on
				bass. Mick and Craig joined a year later, Corey joined in 1997, Sid and Chris joined in 1998 and Jim
				Root completed the classic lineup in 1999.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2 id="p-4">When did Corey Taylor join Slipknot?</h2>
			<p>
				Corey Taylor joined Slipknot in 1997 after being invited to a band practice by Joey, Shawn
				and Mick. He was already fronting <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/inside-stone-sours-new-album-has-corey-gone-too-far">Stone
					Sour</a> at the time, but left to pursue his chance with Slipknot, returning to Stone Sour in 2002
				to record their self-titled debut album.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2 id="p-5">Which member of Slipknot died?</h2>
			<p>
				Founding member and bassist Paul Gray died on May 24 2010 – autopsy results showed he died
				of a morphine overdose. He was buried at a private funeral on May 28 in Slipknot’s hometown of Des
				Moines, Iowa. Donnie Steele filled in for Paul on Slipknot’s 2011 summer tour, but Alessandro ‘V Man’
				Venturella would take up the full-time role in 2014 following the release of <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/review-slipknot-5-the-gray-chapter">.5: The Gray
					Chapter</a>.

			<h2 id="p-6">What is the Slipknot star?</h2>
			<p>
				Slipknot’s logo is a nine-pointed star also known as a nonagram. It represents the strong bond between
				all nine members of the Slipknot family and has nothing to do with Satan or religion, despite some
				claims from scared parents.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2 id="p-7">How did Slipknot get their name?</h2>
			<p>
				The band took their name from the opening track of their demo-cum-album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. which
				was released on Halloween 1996. While it's technically their first proper release, MFKR is not
				considered the first Slipknot album and more of a glorified demo. It includes early versions of the
				songs Only One and Tattered & Torn, which would later appear on <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/blogs-of-war-in-praise-of-slipknot-s-self-titled-album">Slipknot</a>
				in 1999, and Gently, which would appear on <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/every-song-on-slipknot-s-iowa-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Iowa</a>
				in 2001.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2 id="p-8">Do Slipknot still wear masks?</h2>
			<p>
				Slipknot have worn masks and boiler suits since 1997, with the original idea coming from Shawn Crahan
				who developed the character Shawn The Clown. While the band no longer remain anonymous and are often
				pictured without masks now (except Craig Jones who prefers to remain in the shadows), masks are always
				worn on stage.

			<h2 id="p-9">What are the Slipknot masks?</h2>
			<p>
				Each Slipknot member has a different mask, all of which change with each album – some more significantly
				than others. We have <a
					href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-definitive-history-of-every-slipknot-mask">a
					comprehensive list of every Slipknot mask</a> detailing the evolution from the simple, dirty masks
				of the debut album to the sleeker, more ergonomic masks from the .5: The Gray Chapter era.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shawn Crahan has always remained a clown, although sometimes more grotesque as seen with his Iowa mask.
				Sid has retained a gas mask look, diverting away for the Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses album with a
				skeletal look. Chris has always kept his long nose and Craig has maintained his lengthy spikes. Mick’s
				mask has always resembled a metallic hockey mask and Jim’s has continued to have an air of a joker about
				it. Joey’s mask was a Kabuki style and Paul’s was initially a pig but morphed into a Hannibal
				Lecter-esque get-up. Corey’s mask has changed over time, from a dreadlocked leatherface on Slipknot to a
				haunting old man figure (with detachable jaw) for the .5: The Gray Chapter.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2 id="p-10">What is the best Slipknot album?</h2>
			<p>
				The first three Slipknot albums are seen as the strongest (Slipknot, Iowa and Vol. 3: The Subliminal
				Verses) and see the Nine at their creative peak, but Iowa takes the top spot for Slipknot’s best album.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2014, listeners of <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/your-1-slipknot-album-is-iowa">TeamRock
					Radio listeners voted Iowa as their number one Slipknot album</a>, and it is
				the band’s only album to reach #1 in the UK album charts – although All Hope Is Gone and .5: The Gray
				Chapter both topped the US album charts.
